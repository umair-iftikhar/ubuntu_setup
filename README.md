# Ubuntu Setup
Before few months, I started a private gist in which I write a Shell Script to setum my ubuntu on fresh install. I lost that gist, so after I thought to start a project for this purpose. 

In first version just going to write file to install some softwares for setup a system via snap. in future we can make different versions.
Like

1 - Setup for Developer

2 - Setup for PHP Developer

3 - Setup for Business Student

then we may create a script that is intractive enough to manage this like a setup. 

You may ask questions in Issues. I also update the tutorials and guides in wiki. so, get ready.
